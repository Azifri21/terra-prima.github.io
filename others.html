                <p>An optimistic post apocalyptic and fantasy novel. It follows the story of a crystal hunter and her two young apprentices as they try to find their place in a world where losing hope can be as dangerous as the monsters and the poison threatening to drive humanity to extinction.</p>
                <p>Year created: 2024 (chapter 1)</p>

                <p>It's set in the same universe as Terra Prima, although not related to the story and it would have happened decades before the current story time.</p>

                <p>A silent short comic about the mischieves of two characters who appear in another story I wrote (not yet shared since my friend and I are still working on it). You can read it without knowing the novel they're from.</p>

                <p>A short story that's an adaptation of a scene that happens much later on Terra Prima, but I doubt it will be much of a spoiler because by the time we reach that part my art and storytelling will have likely changed a lot. This story was drawn for the 2020 24-Hour Comic Day.</p>

                <h2>Nanoparticles in my coffee</h2>
                <p>I got a Terra Prima minicomic accepted and published in an anthology released in the Netherlands. That was cool! The anthology is called "Over A Coffee: An Anthology" and my story is "Nanoparticles in my coffee".</p> 
                <p>UPDATE: as far as I know, in 2025 there are no physical copies available but the PDF can be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Over-Coffee-Anthology-Faeries-Ents-ebook/dp/B07TXPV3Z6" target="_blank"><strong>purchased on Amazon</strong></a>.</p>
