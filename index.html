            <img src="img/banner.png" alt="Banner main 3 characters" class="responsiveImage">

            <p>Terra Prima is a science fiction comic that follows the journey of an idealistic scientist, a self-absorbed collector of emotions, and a mysterious madman, as well as the people they meet along the way, as they deal with their personal challenges amidst a multiverse-wide conflict.</p>

            <p>This story was inspired by a game my friends and I created. I started drawing it as a comic around 2010, as a practice comic since I had never drawn a long comic before, and the plan was to draw only Book One. As my drawing skills improved, I decided to continue the comic.</p>

            <p><strong>NOTE: since the page is still in test mode, I have only uploaded chapter 1 so far. You can read the rest of the comic on <a href="https://tapas.io/series/Terra-Prima/info" title="a link to my webcomic Terra Prima" target="_blank">Tapas</a>.</strong></p>
