                <p>A scientist who witnessed the collapse of her world and decided that, as a whole, humanity couldn't take care of itself. She secretly developed a type of nanoparticle that could infest and turn people into controllable puppets. After removing most forms of selfish desires from the population, Carla's world experienced a decade of fast technological development. Not only was her world saved, but they also discovered the multiverse and began expanding, assimilating other human-inhabited worlds.</p>
