                <p>I started drawing it as a comic around 2010, as a practice comic since I had never drawn a long comic before, and the plan was to draw only Book One. As my drawing skills improved, I decided to continue the comic.</p>

                <p>This story was initially inspired by a game my friends and I created, althought it has long since taken a different turn. Who knows where it will take us...</p>
