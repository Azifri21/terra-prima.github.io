                <h1>About Terra Prima</h1>

                <p>The story of Terra Prima was initially inspired by a roleplaying game my friends and I created and played but, unfortunately, never finished. Writing and drawing has been a hobby for as long as I can remember, yet as time passed, I found myself having less time and energy to dedicate to it so, one day, I decide to draw a comic, with the idea of combining both writing and drawing into one. For this, I wrote a story loosely inspired by our game, since I had many fond memories of it, and the plan was to draw only up to chapter 9 (book one). As my drawing skills improved, I decided to continue the comic.</p>
