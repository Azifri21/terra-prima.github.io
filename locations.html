                <h2>Terra 1</h2>
                <p>An Earth-like planet home to around 5 billion people. Up to the year 1945, it shared a history similar to our Earth, from which it drifted apart after Erica Cero, the first known plane shifter, established contact with other parallel Earths. It is currently the main core world of the Terra Alliance and where most of its governmental institutions are located.</p>
                <p>Around 80 years ago, a mysterious warship of extraplanar origin arrived and attacked several allied worlds and was ultimately defeated in Terra 1, not before causing severe damage to the planet, but cementing the role of the alliance as a unifying force against threats from other planes of reality.</p>
                <h4>Terra Alliance</h4>
                <p>A social and political association of several thousands of worlds, who share resources and technologies among them. It was established after the attack of a mysterious warship that came from another world and almost obliterated life from several human-inhabited planets. It is well accepted and supported by its members.</p>
                <h4>Correctors</h4>
                <p>The Terra Alliance possesses several branches in its organization. The members of the Mediation and Exploration branch are commonly called correctors and are in charge of discovering and cataloging new worlds, as well as overseeing that all parts of the Alliance function according to their established roles.</p>

                <h2>Terra Obscura</h2>
                <p>A planet with a population of 750 million people, all of which inhabit one large city structured as a grid and covered by protective orbital structures. It is run by megacorporations and is well known for its defense industry and mercenaries.</p>
                <h4>The Conglomerates</h4>
                <p>Refers to the three megacorporations that rule Terra Obscura: Sun Industries, North Electronics, and Larissa Exploration Society. They set the overarching rules the independent districts and businesses have to follow.</p>
                <h4>The Shadows of Terra Obscura</h4>
                <p>Nine of the strongest humans in Terra Obscura. They serve directly under the orders of the Conglomerates and only respond to them.</p>
                <h4>The Trial at the Tower</h4>
                <p>A yearly event that's both a competition and a trade show held in Terra Obscura, where participants can show their skills as well as utilize the newest inventions of the local industries with primary focus on defense, aerospace engineering, and terra-development.</p>

                <h2>Terratex</h2>
                <p>A world that nearly underwent ecocide. The catastrophe was stopped by Carla Luna, who created nanoparticles that turned people into controllable puppets, stopping them from causing more harm to each other and the environment.</p>
                <p>Under Carla's control, this world underwent rapid technological development and at some point, its scientists discovered the multiverse and learned to travel it. Carla is currently on a quest to assimilate other human-inhabited worlds.</p>
                <p>Over time, Carla's approach to assimilation seems to have changed from a direct control into a milder, more indirect, behavioral guidance.</p>

                <h2>Dark Sun</h2>
                <p>Is both the name of a planesphere and a Terra Obscura dissident group. Due to their ruthless attacks on Terra Obscura vessels, they are considered a terrorist organization in Terra Obscura. Their exact goal is unknown, but they seem to be preparing for an operation to be unleashed during the Trial at the Tower.</p>
                <p>The Dark Sun planesphere is unique in several aspects: it has a size that no other known ship can possess due to the limitations of current energy storage technologies.</p>
                <p>In addition, it can produce its own atmosphere, bypassing this way a limitation regular planespheres have, being limited to shift only within a certain range of an Earth-like atmosphere.</p>
